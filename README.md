## 2. Core Strategy

### 2.1 Value Proposition
- **Problem We Solve:** People want to learn AI but don’t know where to start or think it’s too hard.  
- **For Whom:** Students, job seekers, and curious adults with little or no tech background.  
- **Main Benefit:** Clear steps to understand AI and use it for real tasks (resume, LinkedIn, interviews, productivity).  
- **One-Sentence Value Proposition:**  
  “We help beginners learn AI in a fun and easy way—even if they’ve never coded before.”

### 2.2 Arbitrage (Market Gap)
- **Gap:** Most AI courses are too hard or aimed at tech experts.  
- **Why This Exists:** Many teachers assume prior knowledge and skip beginner needs.  
- **How We Win:** We use plain language, short videos, and ready-to-use templates/prompts. We offer a free Starter tier and paid upgrades.

### 2.3 Leverage (Our Tools + Their Motivation)
**Our Tools (Internal):**
- Short, easy-to-follow videos  
- Prompt packs, worksheets, and cheat sheets  
- AI quizzes + practice tasks  
- Friendly help (community/Q&A; optional 1-on-1)  

**Their Motivation (External):**
- AI is everywhere; people don’t want to be left behind  
- Learners want quick job wins (better resume, more interviews)  
- Employers expect basic AI skills

**Why this works:** Templates + small lessons = fast wins → confidence → word-of-mouth and upgrades.
